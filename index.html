    <h1 class="section-title title-why">Why?</h1>
    <p class="section-paragraph">Our mission is simple: to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of animal life
      on our planet. We believe in living in harmony with nature, rather than standing by as species vanish forever.
      Together, we can make a difference. By understanding the value of every living creature and taking action, we can
      ensure a future where animals thrive alongside us. Join us in this vital journey to save and safeguard our
      precious wildlife</p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <p class="section-paragraph">Saving animals is not solely the responsibility of conservationists or experts—it
      starts with each one of us. By making conscious choices and taking small actions in our daily lives, we can create
      a significant impact. Whether it's reducing our carbon footprint, supporting sustainable practices, or advocating
      for stronger conservation policies, we have the power to protect and preserve the incredible creatures we share
      this planet with. Together, let's embrace our role as guardians of nature and leave a legacy of compassion and
      coexistence for generations to come</p>

            dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they
            have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the

            animals in Africa. They have a black, bushy tail that can reach up to 40 centimeters in length, pointed
            ears, and a slender snout. They are tawny red with a white underbelly and blaze on their chests, and also
            have white fur on their throats, which sweeps up and covers the underside of their muzzle. The female wolves
            tend to be paler in color than males and are smaller overall.</p>

            Snow leopards have evolved to live in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. Their thick white-gray coat
            spotted with large black rosettes blends in perfectly with Asia’s steep and rocky, high mountains. Because
            of their incredible natural camouflage, rendering them almost invisible in their surroundings, snow leopards
            are often referred to as the “ghost of the mountains.”

            have hooked upper lips and they are browsers, rather than grazers. This means that they are herbivores who
            do not feed on low-growing vegetation, and their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and
            trees. They have two horns, which grow continuously from the skin at their base throughout their life.</p>

They are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to feed on the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall.</p>

They have thicker fur, and more of it, compared to other great apes. The fur helps them to survive in a habitat where temperatures often drop below freezing. But as humans have moved more and more into the gorillas’ territory, the gorillas have been pushed farther up into the mountains for longer periods, forcing them to endure dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions.</p>

          <p class="species-brief">Larger than turkeys, dodos weighed about 23 kg and had blue-gray plumage and a large head. With no natural predators, the birds were unfazed by the Portuguese sailors that discovered them around 1507. These and subsequent sailors quickly decimated the dodo population as an easy source of fresh meat for their voyages. The later introduction of monkeys, pigs, and rats to the island proved catastrophic to the languishing birds as the mammals feasted on their vulnerable eggs. The last dodo was killed in 1681</p>

These massive, docile animals floated at the surface of the coastal waters but unfortunately had little ability to submerge. This made them easy targets for the harpoons of Russian seal hunters, who prized them as a source of meat on long sea journeys. Killing was often wasteful and the species was exterminated by 1768</p>

          <p class="species-brief">Once famed for its massive migratory flocks that would darken the sky for days, the passenger pigeon was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s. Billions of these gregarious birds once inhabited eastern North America and were similar in appearance to the mourning dove. As American settlers pressed westward, passenger pigeons were slaughtered by the million yearly for their meat and shipped by railway carloads for sale in city markets.</p>

Standing 1.8 meters (6 feet) high at the shoulder with substantial, forward-curving horns, Eurasian aurochs were known for their aggressive temperaments and were battled for sport in ancient Roman arenas. As a game animal, Eurasian aurochs were hunted excessively and gradually became locally extinct in many areas throughout their range.</p>

          <p class="species-brief">The great auk was a flightless seabird that bred in colonies on rocky islands in the North Atlantic, namely St. Kilda, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Funk Island off Newfoundland. The birds were approximately 75 cm (30 inches) long and had short wings which were used for underwater swimming. Utterly defenseless, great auks were killed by rapacious hunters for food and bait, particularly during the early 1800s. Enormous numbers were captured by sailors, who often drove the birds up planks and slaughtered them on their way into the hold of a vessel</p>

These massive animals died out around 7,500 years ago, after the end of the last Ice Age. While climate change definitely played a significant role in their extinction, recent studies suggest that humans may have also been a driving force in their demise, or at least the final cause</p>
