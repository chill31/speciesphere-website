    <h1 class="section-title title-why">Why?</h1>
    <p class="section-paragraph">Our mission is simple: to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of animal life
      on our planet. We believe in living in harmony with nature, rather than standing by as species vanish forever.
      Together, we can make a difference. By understanding the value of every living creature and taking action, we can
      ensure a future where animals thrive alongside us. Join us in this vital journey to save and safeguard our
      precious wildlife</p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <p class="section-paragraph">Saving animals is not solely the responsibility of conservationists or experts—it
      starts with each one of us. By making conscious choices and taking small actions in our daily lives, we can create
      a significant impact. Whether it's reducing our carbon footprint, supporting sustainable practices, or advocating
      for stronger conservation policies, we have the power to protect and preserve the incredible creatures we share
      this planet with. Together, let's embrace our role as guardians of nature and leave a legacy of compassion and
      coexistence for generations to come</p>

    <p class="section-paragraph">To truly conserve and protect animals, it's crucial not only to focus on endangered
      species but also to pay attention to the everyday animals we encounter. By ending the harmful habits that
      adversely affect these animals, we can prevent their decline and extinction. It's up to us to take the initiative
      and make a difference in saving these animals</p>

            dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they
            have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the

            animals in Africa. They have a black, bushy tail that can reach up to 40 centimeters in length, pointed
            ears, and a slender snout. They are tawny red with a white underbelly and blaze on their chests, and also
            have white fur on their throats, which sweeps up and covers the underside of their muzzle. The female wolves

            Snow leopards have evolved to live in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. Their thick white-gray coat
            spotted with large black rosettes blends in perfectly with Asia’s steep and rocky, high mountains. Because
            of their incredible natural camouflage, rendering them almost invisible in their surroundings, snow leopards
            are often referred to as the “ghost of the mountains.”

          <p class="species-brief">The black rhinoceros are the smaller of the two African rhino species. Black rhinos
            have hooked upper lips and they are browsers, rather than grazers. This means that they are herbivores who
            do not feed on low-growing vegetation, and their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and
            trees. They have two horns, which grow continuously from the skin at their base throughout their life.</p>

          <p class="species-brief">Leatherback turtles are named for their shell which is leather-like rather than hard, like other turtles. They are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to feed on the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall.</p>

They have thicker fur, and more of it, compared to other great apes. The fur helps them to survive in a habitat where temperatures often drop below freezing. But as humans have moved more and more into the gorillas’ territory, the gorillas have been pushed farther up into the mountains for longer periods, forcing them to endure dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions.</p>

The Javan rhino is very similar in appearance to the closely-related greater one-horned rhinoceros, but has a much smaller head and less apparent skin folds.</p>
